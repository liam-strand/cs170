## Problem 1

Write a CFG for the following language over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$:

$$L_1 = \{w \mid w \text{ contains the substring } baa\}$$

S &rarr; NPN \
N &rarr; aN | bN | $\varepsilon$ \
P &rarr; baa

in CNF (ish)

S &rarr; GN \
G &rarr; NP \
N &rarr; AN | BN | $\varepsilon$ \
P &rarr; QA \
Q &rarr; BA \
B &rarr; b \
A &rarr; a

## Problem 2

Prove that the following language is not context free $\Sigma = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$

$$L_2 = \{w \in \Sigma * \mid \text{ There are an equal number of 1's and 2's, and of 3's and 4's}\}$$

**Proof by Pumping Lemma**:

1. Assume $L_2$ is context free and thus has pumping length $p$.
2. Let the input be $1^p3^p2^p4^p$
3. $1^p3^p2^p4^p = uvxyz$, so where do we put $v$ and $y$?

We have some number like $1111333322224444$ with $p = 4$ 

$vxy$ can either be entirely within one of the contiguous number sections, or it can span between two adjacent sections.

If $vxy$ is entirely within the $1$ section, then we can pump the $1$s so that there are not an equal number of $1$s and $2$s (and vice versa if we pump $2$s). The same logic applies to the $3$s and $4$s.

If $vxy$ spans across the $1$s and $3$s, and we pump that section, there will be a nonequal numbers of $1$s and $2$s (and $3$s and $4$s). The same logic applies if we span $vxy$ across the $3$s and $2$s or across the $2$s and $4$s.

Thus with the input string $1^p3^p2^p4^p$, there is no section $vxy$ that in the string that is fewer than $p$ characters long where $|vy| > 0$ that can be pumped and produce strings that remain in the language $L_2$.

$$\Longrightarrow \Longleftarrow$$

Thus $L_2$ is not context-free.

## Problem 3

Write a CFG for the following language over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$:

$$L_3 = \{\text{The compliment of } a^nb^n\}$$
